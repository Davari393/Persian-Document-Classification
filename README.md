# Persian-Document-Classification
Currently, the classification subject of Persian articles is sparse, limited, and non-automatic.This repo proposes methods based on deep learning for extracting features of Persian texts, methods for classifying texts and finally identifying the subject matter of the collection. The Hamshahri dataset (a sub-body containing 166,000 documents with a specific theme), one of the most prestigious Persian language resources in the field of natural language, is applied for feature extraction and text classification.
